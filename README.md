- 🔭 I’m currently working on: Automatic Driven Virtual Reality Editing System & ETL for Health Big Data 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Automatic cinematography with Unity, Machine Learning Development, ETL with R  
- 👯 I’m collaborating with [GPDS - UnB](http://www.gpds.ene.unb.br/) & [LMI - Sentinela](http://www.lmi-sentinela.unb.br/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I understand that science and art can become a powerful tool to overcome inequality in the world, turning science less boring and art even more expansive. Contributing with Audiovisual Projects (as well as other cultural projects) is a personal goal, which I’d could collaborate to bring a positive social impact by making use of the technical knowledge developed in academic context.
